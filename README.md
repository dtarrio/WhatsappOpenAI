POC of an API that interacts with the GPT4o model and with the Meta For Business APP to offer communication with the model through WhatsApp. It is enough to specialize the model so that WhatsApp can respond directly to the specific domain of the APP exposed by Meta for Business. NGrok is used to expose the API and it is necessary to configure the Meta for Business APP by exposing a WhatsApp number.
